He does have a wide draw to overcome but is likely to use his early gate speed to get across without using up too much energy. He may be hard to peg back in the run to the line and rates as one of the hardest to beat. GEORGIE GEORGE (11) ran a good race to finish third at long odds in his last start over 1000m when resuming from a spell. He takes a drop in class and if suited to the polytrack can figure in the finish. PHAKA IMALI (7) won a good race in his last start over this course and distance. He was settled at the rear of the field and finished his race off strongly. If repeating that effort in this field he can follow up. LORD EDWARD (6) was doing his best work at the finish over this course and distance last time. If jumping on equal terms terms with his rivals should run a big race.","additional_data":"{\"revealed_race_info\":{\"track_name\":\"Greyville\",\"state\":\"SAF\",\"country\":\"SAF\",\"number\":6,\"race_name\":\"\",\"time\":\"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\"}}"},"venue_id":"e2f2c9d6-2188-4d9d-9fe1-51f5ecc766d3","venue_name":"Greyville","venue_state":"SAF","venue_country":"SAF"},"4718d48f-3f2c-4cc8-9063-c7a9a180c631":{"race_id":"4718d48f-3f2c-4cc8-9063-c7a9a180c631","race_name":"Eventmasters.Co.Uk Mares' Maiden Hurdle (Gbb Race)","race_number":2,"meeting_id":"f85d5ec4-33a5-4101-98ef-f0e32ca369d6","meeting_name":"Warwick","category_id":"4a2788f8-e825-4d36-9894-efd4baf1cfae","advertised_start":"2023-05-01T23:22:00Z","race_form":{"distance":3218,"distance_type":{"name":"Metres","short_name":"m"},"track_condition":{"name":"Soft","short_name":"soft"},"weather":{"name":"Showers"},"race_comment":"QUEENS GAMBLE (7) won her first two races on the flat at Cheltenham before reappearing in February finishing second to a subsequent winner at Market Rasen. Was midfield back at Cheltenham when last seen in March and rates a clear danger on jumps debut. NIGHT ON THE TOWN (6) has placed once from three starts on the flat.

Makes his fourth start over hurdles and first for a new trainer. Interesting runner racing second-up following wind surgery and is one to watch in the market. Feared. MOONSHINE SPIRIT (7) was not disgraced when fourth of twelve on hurdle debut in February. No surprise if he has improved since. Can make his presence felt. IOLAOS DU MOU (6) looked promising landing a Newbury jumpers flat in November. Consider on initial hurdle outing.

WARM IN GOREY (10) finished runner-up in that Downpatrick handicap hurdle and could give a bold sight.
